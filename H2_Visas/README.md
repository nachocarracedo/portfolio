# H2 VISAS

This [notebook](https://github.com/nachocarracedo/portfolio/blob/master/H2_Visas/h2_visas_analysis.ipynb) explores the [dataset](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/H-2-certification-data#standardized-data) of H2 visa applications. The U.S. Department of Labor releases this data as Excel (.XLS) files and BuzzFeed News has been tracking and hosting these datasets on Github. 

There are 2 types of H2 Visas:

* [H2-A](https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/temporary-workers/h-2a-temporary-agricultural-workers): Allows foreign agricultural workers with a job offer for seasonal agricultural work in the US 

* [H2-B](https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/temporary-workers/h-2b-temporary-non-agricultural-workers): Allows U.S. employers or U.S. agents who meet specific regulatory requirements to bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill temporary nonagricultural jobs

After cleaning the data this [notebook](https://github.com/nachocarracedo/portfolio/blob/master/H2_Visas/h2_visas_analysis.ipynb) tries to answer the following questions:

* 1 How application status have change over time?
* 2 How have the number of approved workers has changed  over time? and the number of employers?
* 3 Which states request the most visas and how has this changed over time?
* 4 Number of approved Visas per state in 2015
