These are some of the projects and presentations (tutorials) I've worked on. Find links and topics here:

* [**Bespoke project [Coming 08/16/18...]**](https://github.com/nachocarracedo/buysell/) [**PYTHON**]<br>
*Project that scans local craiglist listings and match them to ebay/amazon products to find where the biggest price marging is

* [**Machine learning tutorial classification**](https://github.com/nachocarracedo/portfolio/blob/master/ML_tutorial_python_classification/classification_tutorial.ipynb) [**MACHINE LEARNING**, **TUTORIAL**]<br>
*Tutorial I made to show how an end to end machine learning classification project would look like (python)*

* [**Machine learning tutorial regression**](https://github.com/nachocarracedo/portfolio/blob/master/ML_tutorial_python_regression/regression_tutorial.ipynb) [**MACHINE LEARNING**, **TUTORIAL**]<br>
*Tutorial I made to show how an end to end machine learning regression project would look like (python)*

* [**Subway dataset exploration**](https://github.com/nachocarracedo/portfolio/blob/master/Hubway/Hubway.md) [**EDA**, **VISUALIZATION**]<br>
*Project that explores via visualizations the Bostonâ€™s shared bike system data set (R)*

* [**Visualize your twitter account**](https://github.com/nachocarracedo/my_twitter) [**VISUALIZATION**]<br>
*Script that leverages twitter API to generate a visualization of your twitter account (python)*

*Python notebook that works with the Lending Club data set and predicts if a loan will be paid (python)*

* [**Visualizations (as a Systems Engineer)**](https://github.com/nachocarracedo/Visualizations) [**VISUALIZATION**]<br>
*Here I show some visualizations I made for some projects I was involved with at work (DELLEMC Systems Engineer). These were requested by project managers/stakeholders*

* [**Tensor Flow Tutorial - CNNs**](https://github.com/nachocarracedo/tensor_flow/blob/master/CNN_MNIST_example.ipynb) [**MACHINE LEARNING**, **TUTORIAL**]<br>
*Tutorial I made to show how to build a CNN with Tensor Flow (python)*


... This is still a work in progress. I'm currently cleaning/commenting other projects that I'll add shortly
